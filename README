This project includes a few procedures to help you with disk management.

jobsCleanup: procedure to delete jobs older than a specified number of
days. It will also delete associated workspace job directories. You
can also provide a property name, if this property is attached to the
job, it won't be deleted now matter how old. A report only mode
prevents any real deletion.

artifactsCleanup: procedure to delete artifacts older than a specified number
of days. Same as above, a property allows to prevent deletion. Once the
artifacts have been deleted, artifact repositories and artifact caches are
cleaned as well (deleting stale artifacts).  A report only mode prevents any
real deletion.

acquireSemaphore & releaseSemaphore: those 2 procedures are used to create a gate for a set of steps. The important part is to use a resource with a step limit of one to ensure the atomicty of increasing and decreasing the gate value.

saveProjects: a simple procdure to export individually all (non plugins) projects to create you own versioning. Better to run on a nightly schedule.
