        <p>EC-Admin is a collection of administrative procedures to help you
manage your server. Its inception was sparked by requests from customers
during my Professional Services engagements. It has grown over the years to
what it is now.</p>

		<p>It contains the following modules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#look">Look and Feel</a></li>
			<li><a href="#jobs">Jobs and Workspaces management</a></li>
			<li><a href="#plugin">Plugins</a></li>
			<li><a href="#artifacts">Artifacts management</a></li>
			<li><a href="#backup">Object export and backup</a></li>
			<li><a href="#semaphore">Semaphore management</a></li>
			<li><a href="#perf">Performance metrics</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>
		
        <p>This collection of procedures can be found on our 
        	<a href="https://github.com/electriccommunity/EC-Admin">GitHub
        		repository</a>. It is available as a plugin delivered 
        	in the form of a .jar file or you can simply get the source code 
        	and recompile it yourself.</p>

		<p>To install the plugin, use the "Install from File/URL" tab in the
			administration/Plugins or use the "installPlugin" API.</p>
 
		<p>To install on 4.0.x or or 4.1.x, import the EC_4.0.xml file. Be 
			aware that some features are not present as the original project 
			makes use of createJobStep() API which was introduced in 4.2.0:<br/>
ectool import /path_to/EC-Admin_for_EC_4.0.xml --disableSchedules 1</p>

		<p>If you get an error with the passKey, use the "--force 1" option</p>

    <p>
        IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
        parameters are shown in <span class="required">bold
        italics</span>.
    </p>

		<h1><a name="look"></a>Look and Feel</h1>
		<h2>changeBannerColor</h2>
		<p>If you work on multiple Commander servers like a development and a 
			production instances, this procedure is for you. It allows you to change 
			the color of the top banner and the logo to make it easier to identify your different 
			servers. Feel free 
			to <a href="mailto:lrochette@electric-cloud.com">send me</a> new ones if 
			you have a more artistic touch than me. Or better
			push your changes to

			<h2>jobCleanup_byResult:</h2> 
            <p>A procedure to delete jobs older than a specified number of days.
It will also delete associated workspace job directories. It will keep the
number of successful, failed and warning jobs you entered. You can also
provide a property name, if this property is attached to the job, it won't be
deleted no matter how old. A report only mode prevents any real deletion.</p>

			<h2>deleteWorksapceOrphans:</h2> 

            <p>A procedure to crawl a workspace directory to find orphan jobs
(directories without a matching job) on a specified resource.</p>

			<h2>deleteObjects:</h2> 
            <p>A procedure to quickly delete jobs or workflows older than a
specified number of days. It will <b>not</b> delete associated workspace job
directories. This is for customers with huge job or workflow database.</p>


		<h1><a name="plugin"></a>Plugins</h1>
		<h2>Plugin Synchronization</h2>
		<p>This procedure synchronizes plugins between the server and 
		a resource. Plugins are uploaded first as artifacts if it has not been 
		done already and then downloaded on the resource if it does not 
		already exist in the plugins directory.</p>
		
		<h2>Plugin creation</h2>
		<h3>createPluginFromProject</h3>
		<p><b>Note:</b> This procedure requires access to the jar or zip 
			executable in the PATH.</p>
		<p>The procedure "createPluginFromProject" allows the transformation of a

		        </tbody>
		    </table>

			<img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/help/createPluginFromProject.png" 
				 alt="createPluginFromProject parameters" />

		<p>At the project level, you can define the following properties to 
			alter the behavior of the plugin creation:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>ec_visibility:</b></dt>
				<dd>Choose <b>all</b> to have the plugin shows in the project 
					list (like EC-Admin), or <b>pickListOnly</b> (default) to 
					have your procedures available only through the plugin 
					procedure picker (when you choose plugin as a step).</dd>
				<dt><b>help:</b></dt>
				<dd>This property allows you to create a Help page associated 
					with your plugin. The page you are currently reading is 
					created this way so feel free to explore the help property
					 in the EC-Admin plugin/project for an example.</dd>
				<dt><b>promoteAction</b></dt>
				<dd>This proeprty would contain some Perl code to take action
					when the plugin change state. Look at the ec_setup property
					in the plugins installed on your system to get a better idea
					of what you can accomplish.<br/>
					For example to set a property hwne the plugin is pomoted 
					you could add the the following code to the promoteAction
					procedure:<br/>
					<pre><code>
if ( $promoteAction eq 'promote' ) {
    $batch->setProperty( "/projects/$pluginName/addedByPromote", "123" );
}
					</code></pre>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		<p>In addition each procedure can modify the behavior with the 
			following 2 properties:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>exposeToPlugin:</b></dt>
				<dd>This property if set to 1 will add the procedure to 
					ec_setup to be shown in the procedure picker list when 
					choosing a plugin step.</dd>
				<dt><b>descriptionForPlugin:</b></dt>
				<dd>This property will be shown as the description in the 
					picker list mentioned above. If it's empty or non-existent,
					 the description will be description of the procedure 
					 itself.</dd>
			</dl>

		<h3>projectAsCode</h3>

		<p><b>Note:</b> This procedure requires access to a resource with the 
			Commander SDK installed.</p>

		<p>This procedure is an extension of createPluginFromProject. It also
		creates a plugin but instead of simply exporting the project, it
		"explodes" each step in its own file for finer granularity check in
		in your favorite SCM tool.<br/>
		All the properties associated with createPluginFromProject still apply.</p>

		<p><b>Note:</b> EC-Admin is released on 
		<a href="https://github.com/electriccommunity/EC-Admin">GitHub</a> using 
		this procedure.</p>

		<h1><a name="artifacts"></a>Artifact Management</h1>
		
		<h2>artifactsCleanup</h2> 
		
		<p>A procedure to delete artifact versions older than a specified number
of days. Same as for jobs above, a property allows preventing the deletion. Once the
artifacts have been deleted, artifact repositories and artifact caches are
cleaned as well (deleting stale artifacts).  A report mode prevents any
real deletion.</p>

		<h2>artifactsCleanup_byQuantity</h2>

		<p>As "ArtifactsCleanup"", this procedure deletes artifact versions 
			older than a specified number
of days but keeps only X per Artifact. Again, a property allows preventing the 
deletion. Once the
artifacts have been deleted, artifact repositories and artifact caches are
cleaned as well (deleting stale artifacts).  A report only mode prevents any
real deletion.</p>

		<h1><a name="backup"></a>Object export and backup</h1>

        <p>This set of procedures is to help you export objects from
ElectricCommander for a potential inclusion into your SCM for
versioning.</p>
		
		<h2>saveProjects</h2>

        <p>This procedure simply exports your projects in a directory on the
server. It is recommended to enable the nightly schedule associated
with it to backup your projects on a regular basis.</p>

		<h2>saveAllObjects</h2>

        <p>This procedure brings a finer granularity to a full server export. For 
example to retrieve an object after a wrong action or a bad code change. By 
default it exports projects and each procedure individually. In addition by 
enabling the matching checkboxes, you can also export resources, 
resource pools, workspaces, users and groups.</p>

		<h1><a name="semaphore"></a>Semaphore Management</h1>

		<h2>acquireSemaphore and releaseSemaphore:</h2>
			
		<p>Those 2 procedures are used to create a 
gate for a set of steps. The important part is to use a resource with a step 
limit of one to ensure the atomicity of increasing and decreasing the gate 
value.</p>

		<h1><a name="perf"></a>Performance metrics</h1>
		<p>This procedure returns some information about your 
			ElectricCommander server like number of processors, total RAM, 
			available RAM, 
ping times with agents, relative performance of agents, ... 
In addition it checks the amount of time spent running steps on the server 
local agents as this should be minimized as much as possible.</p>
